Distributed Systems Project

You are required to develop a dynamic client server based communication system that is based on Java/Corba. The dynamic client server can be a game-based system (e.g. Tic-Tac-Toe). 

The system should consist of a client that can access various systems that allow communication to take place such as an address book and chatroom, etc.
