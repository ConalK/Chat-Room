Distributed Systems Project

Objective

You are required to develop a dynamic client server based communication system that is based on Java/Corba. The dynamic client server can be a game-based system (e.g. Tic-Tac-Toe). 

The system should consist of a client that can access various systems that allow communication to take place such as an address book and chatroom, etc.

Project Description

For my project, I created two communication systems which are an address book and a chat room. I also created a game for this project. The objective of the game is to guess a number which is randomly chosen by the computer using the Java Random class. This creates a number between 1 and 100 which the user has to guess. The player is informed if the number they guess is too high or too low and whenever they guess the right number they are told how many attempts it took them to guess the number.

To run my project you start the name server then run CommunicationSystemServer followed by CommunicationSystemClient. I have also included a batch file which does this.
